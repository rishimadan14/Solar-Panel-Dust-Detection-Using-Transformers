# Solar-Panel-Dust-Detection-Using-Transformers
An automated process for detecting dust on solar panels that can accurately predict the power loss caused by the presence of dust.
Based on the provided information, SolNet is a specific neural network architecture designed to classify solar datasets into clean and dirty panels. It consists of 8 convolutional and pooling layers followed by 3 dense layers, or fully connected layers. The architecture aims to reduce computational complexity and overfitting by incorporating max-pooling layers with dropouts and batch normalization layers after each conv-pool pair. The convolutional layers use 64, 128, and 256 filters with kernel sizes of 11x11, 5x5, and 2x2 and strides of 4x4 and 1x1. The output layer uses a sigmoid activation function.

On the other hand, ResNet (short for "Residual Network") is a widely used neural network architecture that is known for its ability to effectively train very deep neural networks by using residual connections. These connections allow gradients to flow more easily through the network, which helps avoid the vanishing gradient problem that can occur in deep networks.
